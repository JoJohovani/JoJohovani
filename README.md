# Hi there, I'm JoJohovani! 👋

I'm a passionate **designer** crafting intuitive experiences with Figma, and an **AI enthusiast** who loves building with Python. My mission? To create new things that spark joy, solve real problems, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## 🚀 What I Do
- **UI/UX Design:** Bringing ideas to life in Figma with a focus on user-centered design.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Exploring the intersection of creativity and machine learning with Python.
- **Innovation:** Always dreaming up new projects, from smart tools to playful experiments.
- **Collaboration:** Thriving in creative teams and open to new opportunities!

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
